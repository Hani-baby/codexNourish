# Meal Plan Generation System - Complete Documentation

## Overview

This system generates AI-powered weekly meal plans with full recipe details. It handles 1-6 meals per day (7-42 recipes per week) using OpenAI's Responses API with chunked execution to avoid timeouts.

## Core Functions

### 1. **Meal Plan Orchestrator** (`meal-plan-orchestrator`)

**Purpose**: Coordinates the entire meal plan generation workflow using an AI planner agent.

**Key Features**:
- Uses OpenAI Responses API with tool calling
- Chunked execution (7 recipes per chunk) to avoid 75-second Supabase timeout
- Stateful conversation with fresh context on each chunk
- Automatic retry logic for failed operations
- Server-side fallback pipeline if AI stops prematurely

**Flow**:
1. Generate draft (meal structure with titles)
2. Validate draft (pre-assignment)
3. Assign existing recipes to slots
4. Generate missing recipes (in parallel batches)
5. Validate again (post-assignment)
6. Finalize and save to database

**Configuration**:
```typescript
const MAX_PLANNER_ITERATIONS = 12;      // Max AI decision loops
const MAX_TOOL_FAILURES = 2;            // Failures before aborting
const RECIPES_PER_CHUNK = 7;            // Recipes per orchestrator run
const BATCH_SIZE = 7;                   // Parallel recipe generation
const TIME_BUDGET_MS = 60000;           // 60s per batch
```

**Chunked Execution**:
- Processes 7 recipes per chunk
- Saves state between chunks (`planner_state`, `pending_recipe_indexes`, `chunk_number`)
- Self-invokes for next chunk via `triggerNextChunk()`
- Each chunk starts fresh OpenAI conversation with full context

**State Management**:
```typescript
interface PlannerState {
  draftId?: string;
  draftStatus: "none" | "pending" | "ready" | "failed";
  validations: {
    pre_assignment?: ValidationSnapshot;
    post_assignment?: ValidationSnapshot;
  };
  assignment?: AssignmentSnapshot;
  recipeGeneration?: RecipeGenerationSnapshot;
  finalization?: FinalizationSnapshot;
  events: PlannerEvent[];
  faults: PlannerFault[];
}
```

### 2. **Draft Generator** (`generate-meal-plan-draft`)

**Purpose**: Creates the meal plan structure (dates, meal types, titles).

**Input**:
- Household ID
- Date range (start_date, end_date)
- Meals per day (1-6)
- User preferences

**Output**:
- Draft ID
- Array of meal items with:
  - Date
  - Meal type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack, dessert, late_snack)
  - Title (e.g., "Grilled Chicken Salad")
  - Servings
  - Tags

**Model**: gpt-4o-mini
**Cost**: ~$0.0012 per draft (0.12 cents)

---

### 3. **Recipe Assigner** (`recipe-assigner`)

**Purpose**: Matches draft meal titles to existing recipes in the database using semantic search.

**How it Works**:
1. Generates embeddings for draft meal titles
2. Searches recipe database using vector similarity
3. Assigns best matches based on:
   - Title similarity
   - Meal type compatibility
   - Dietary constraints
   - Household preferences

**Model**: text-embedding-3-small
**Cost**: ~$0.0002 per assignment (0.02 cents)

**Output**:
- Matched recipe IDs
- Unmatched item indexes (need generation)
- Assignment statistics

---

### 4. **Recipe AI** (`recipes-ai`)

**Purpose**: Generates complete recipes for unmatched meal items.

**Input**:
- Title (e.g., "Grilled Chicken Salad")
- Meal type
- Servings
- Constraints:
  - Required dietary tags
  - Blocked ingredients
  - Blocked tags
  - Max prep/cook time
- Household preferences
- Idempotency key (prevents duplicates)

**Output**:
```json
{
  "title": "Grilled Chicken Salad",
  "description": "...",
  "ingredients": [
    {
      "item": "chicken breast",
      "quantity": "2",
      "unit": "pieces",
      "preparation": "grilled and sliced"
    }
  ],
  "instructions": [
    {
      "step": 1,
      "instruction": "Season chicken with salt and pepper..."
    }
  ],
  "prep_time_minutes": 15,
  "cook_time_minutes": 20,
  "servings": 4,
  "nutrition": {
    "calories": 350,
    "protein_g": 42,
    "carbs_g": 12,
    "fat_g": 14
  },
  "tags": ["high-protein", "low-carb", "gluten-free"]
}
```

**Model**: gpt-4o-mini
**Configuration**:
```typescript
max_output_tokens: 4096  // Increased from 1600 to handle complex recipes
temperature: 0.8
timeout: 30 seconds
```

**Cost**: ~$0.002 per recipe (0.2 cents)

**Retry Logic**:
- Max 3 attempts per recipe
- Retries on timeout or incomplete responses
- Respects time budget (60s per batch)

---

## Parallel Recipe Generation

**Strategy**: Generate 7 recipes in parallel per batch to maximize speed while staying under timeout limits.

**Performance**:
- Sequential: ~10 seconds per recipe = 70 seconds for 7 recipes ❌
- Parallel (batch of 7): ~10 seconds total = 85% faster ✅

**Implementation**:
```typescript
const batches = [[0,1,2,3,4,5,6], [7,8,9,10,11,12,13], ...];

for (const batch of batches) {
  const promises = batch.map(index => generateRecipe(index));
  const results = await Promise.all(promises);
  // Process results
}
```

**Logging**:
```
Chunk 1, Batch 1/1: Starting parallel recipe generation
[Batch 1] Starting recipe generation - "Grilled Chicken Salad"
[Batch 1] Recipe generated successfully - recipe_id: abc123
Chunk 1, Batch 1/1 completed - 7 successes, 0 failures, 62,450ms
```

---

## Meal Slot Configuration

**Supported Meals Per Day**: 1-6

```typescript
const DEFAULT_SLOTS = [
  "breakfast",    // 1 meal/day
  "lunch",        // 2 meals/day
  "dinner",       // 3 meals/day
  "snack",        // 4 meals/day
  "dessert",      // 5 meals/day
  "late_snack"    // 6 meals/day
];
```

**Weekly Capacity**:
| Meals/Day | Total Recipes | Chunks Needed | Total Time |
|-----------|---------------|---------------|------------|
| 1 | 7 | 1 | ~60s |
| 2 | 14 | 2 | ~2min |
| 3 | 21 | 3 | ~3min |
| 4 | 28 | 4 | ~4min |
| 5 | 35 | 5 | ~5min |
| 6 | 42 | 6 | ~6min |

## Error Handling & Resilience

### 1. **Stuck Job Detection**
- Jobs in "processing" for >5 minutes are marked as failed
- Prevents infinite processing states
- Allows new job creation

### 2. **Timeout Protection**
- Supabase free tier: 75-second "EarlyDrop" limit
- Chunked execution keeps each run under 60 seconds
- Self-invocation for continuation

### 3. **Incomplete Response Handling**
- Increased `max_output_tokens` to 4096
- Retry logic for incomplete/timeout responses
- Fallback to simpler recipes if needed

### 4. **Conversation State Management**
- Each chunk starts fresh OpenAI conversation
- Full state context provided via `composeResumeMessage()`
- No `response_id` saved across chunks (prevents "No tool output found" errors)

### 5. **Fallback Pipeline**
- If AI stops prematurely, server completes workflow
- Runs assignment → generation → validation → finalization
- Ensures meal plans always complete

## Cost Analysis

### Per 42-Recipe Meal Plan

| Component | Calls | Cost |
|-----------|-------|------|
| Draft Generation | 1 | $0.0012 |
| Recipe Assignment | 1 | $0.0002 |
| Recipe Generation (30 new) | 30 | $0.0608 |
| Orchestrator | 7 | $0.0019 |
| **TOTAL** | | **$0.064** |

**≈ 6.4 cents per meal plan**

### Cost Scenarios

**Best Case** (most recipes exist):
- 10 new recipes needed
- **Cost**: ~$0.025 (2.5 cents)

**Average Case** (mix of new/existing):
- 20-30 new recipes needed
- **Cost**: ~$0.045-$0.065 (4.5-6.5 cents)

**Worst Case** (all new recipes):
- 42 recipes generated
- **Cost**: ~$0.087 (8.7 cents)

### Monthly Projections

**1,000 active users** (1 plan/week):
- 1,000 × 4 weeks × $0.064 = **$256/month**

**10,000 active users**:
- 10,000 × 4 weeks × $0.064 = **$2,560/month**
