-- FIXED RLS Policies for Household System
-- Purpose: Simpler policies that avoid circular dependencies
-- Date: 2025-10-09
-- Issue: Previous policies caused recursive lookups resulting in 500 errors

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
-- IMPORTANT: Drop ALL existing policies first to avoid conflicts
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
